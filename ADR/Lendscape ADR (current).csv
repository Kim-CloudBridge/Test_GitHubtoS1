8,Infrastructure,AWS Managed Microsoft AD for OS authentication,Superseded,"Lendscape requires to have an Active Directory for server domain join and OS authentication in AWS. They have an existing AD that they use on premise, and an Azure AD. Lendscape wanted to have a new Active Directory to use in AWS. Currently, Lendscape plans to use this AD as standalone and no integration or connection to other AD. But in the future, there might have plans to establish forest trust in the On-premise AD.",To use AWS Managed Microsoft AD that will be created in a central AWS account (Shared services account) and with directory sharing created to the other AWS accounts in Lendscape's LZ,"To achieve, ease of setup and maintenance because of the managed services offering of AWS. Can be easily integrated to other AWS accounts by directory sharing. And with Multi-AZ provisioning for the domain controller to avoid single point of failure.

While accepting, limited AD configurations like lack of enterprise admin access. Dependency on AWS dashboard to perform AD maintenance and configuration. And cost considerations, for it is more expensive than having a self-hosted AD.",Jasper Meneses,12-Feb-24
9,Infrastructure,AWS Managed Microsoft AD for OS authentication,Accepted,"Lendscape will have to upgrade to an enterprise subscription of AWS Managed Microsoft AD to be able to replicate the directory to another AWS region (APAC) where they have to onboard some of their customers. The cost of an enterprise subscription is something that they have to consider for it is a very expensive just for the use of the multi-region AD, organization size is not in an enterprise level so the added AD objects and other features will also be a waste. Add to the fact that the AD will also need to be shared across possibly 50+ AWS accounts and each directory sharing has a per-hour cost.","To use standard edition AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory in a central account that will be shared to other account without the use of directory sharing. With the use of transit gateway with the correct routing, firewall and security group rules in place, we'd be able to by pass the AD route to other account without the use of directory sharing.","To achieve, a cheaper cost of using the standard subscription of AWS Managed Microsoft AD while still being able to share the AD properly to other accounts.

While accepting, added complexity of performing the workaround of directory sharing and developing scripts needed to join/unjoin instances to the domain in another accounts. And still having to figure out how will it be possible to share cross-region.",Jasper Meneses,12-Feb-24

While accepting, a single-AZ FSx that offers lower availability compared to a multi-AZ deployment.",Jasper Meneses,12-Feb-24
11,Infrastructure,Use of Amazon FSx for Netapp for SQL File storage,Accepted,"Lendscape found that the Amazon FSx for Windows costly for the Multi-AZ setup, so they went for the cheaper option of Amazon FSx. They also have a base latency requirements for the file share performance.",To use Amazon FSx for Netapp Ontap with Multi-AZ as storage layer for SQL,"To achieve, the cheaper option for FSx, which is the Netapp Ontap, and proved to perform better than the Windows FSx based on performance testing done by Lendscape.

While accepting, the complexity of use with the Storage virtual machines and volumes mounting and maintenance, compared to Amazon FSx for Windows.",Jasper Meneses,12-Feb-24
12,Devops,CICD tools and pipeline,Accepted,Lendscape will need a CICD pipeline/tools to deploy application code to client accounts. The CICD tools will need to be in a central account where it can access all other client accounts for central management of deployment pipelines. Jenkins is what Lendscape is using in their previous environment so they have prior experience in using Jenkins.,"To create a new AWS account specifically for CICD toolings, this account will have access to all client accounts and be able to deploy application code from this account. To use Jenkins for CICD pipeline installed in EC2 instances.","To achieve, a CICD deployment pipeline and tools that Lendscape has experience on. Central account for managing all deployment pipelines.

This will also be similar to current onpremise implementation.

While accepting, Terraform code has to be updated, moving DMZ modules from client resource into ancillary. Planning of IP space, Configuration Management, routing, and strategy for resource exposure should also be planned.",Mark Cahinde,15-Feb-24
14,AWS Landing Zone,One AWS Account for each Domain,Accepted,"A Domain in Lendscape space can be equivalent to PROD, TEST, or DR. This is similarly known as Environment names. Lendscape has their environments under each Domain to cover the multiple environment approach their client has, and to completely set the demarcation line between live and non-live resources.",To use one AWS account per Domain present for the onboarded clients,"To achieve, is a simpler and organized approach, and is not very far from the original Organization proposal by Cloud Bridge. It imposes complete control and governance for each Domain.

While accepting, it is to be noted that Domains are not to be confused with Environments. Furthermore, higher environment like pre-prod is considered a part of PROD domain due to likelyness to production as opposed to being part of TEST domain being it non-live.",Mark Cahinde,15-Feb-24
15,AWS Landing Zone,Keep Network Architecture for APAC,Accepted,"Lendscape operates in multiple regions currently and would reflect as is in the AWS Landing Zone. APAC region as of Feb-24 will only be moving 2 T3 clients into AWS space, engaging with the question of whether it is economical or practical to keep the architecture the same as in EMEA.",To use Sydney region for APAC customers of Lendscape HMS,"To achieve, a more similar regional presence will continue, simplifying admin and management from development and operational perspective.

While accepting, scaling up for the future has to be considered in terms of cost, size, and business drivers.",Mark Cahinde,15-Feb-24
17,Networking,Cross Account Bucket Access,Open,A bucket has been requested to be created in CICD account that will be shared among client accounts for the purpose of holding FCR atifacts. To establish connectivity from client accounts to public S3 endpoint a network change / addition is required. ,This can be achieved by adding gateway endpoint directly to APP-VPC or create an Interface Endpoint we can allow on the Central Egress if traffic monitoring is utmost priority.,"To attain cost savings, it is sufficient to employ a gateway endpoint, as this service is provided for free by AWS. However, if prioritizing security is crucial and the ability to monitor all traffic by directing it to a central egress is necessary, then the use of an Interface endpoint is recommended.",Krizia Mallari,15-Feb-24
18,AppStream POC,Serverless Design,Accepted,Cloud Bridge provided 3 different designs to Lendscape. One serverless saas portal using Cognito and two using iDP and AD,Due to Lendscape's requirements (no iDP and AD usage) the serverless design with a saas basic portal using Cognito to login and encapsulating client users was selected by Lendscape,"To achieve, user base isolation, future MFA, simplicity and allowing Lendscape to offer their desktop client without using their internal VPN",Marcos Ginel,15-Feb-24
19,AppStream POC,Cognito User self-registration and MFA,Open,SaaS Portal for AppStream allows users to register themselves in a public website and confirm their registration. This is something Lendscape doesn't want to have. But the portal should allow users to use MFA. Dev effort is required,To remove from both Cognito API and website selt-registration and create their users manually by an administrator. Setting up MFA is still an open topic,"To achieve, total control of user base and not allow any posibility of someone out of organization to register/hack into the system. MFA, to achieve, a more secure login process into the system

This manual management of user could represent a pain point if the user pool is too big for a Client, although this could be automated in any kind of way, with terraform for example. Regarding MFA, we need to investigate what it's the best option that fits Lendscape current requirements as MFA allows you to set it up as optional, mandatory, using SMS, etc...",Marcos Ginel,15-Feb-24
20,Networking,Fortigate firewall,Accepted,Lendscape needs Firewall for IDS/IPS for Network Security of the Environment. Cloud Bridge has worked with Lendscape and Fortinet to gather requirements and design firewall layer to be used in the architecture featuring Fortinet's Next-Gen Fortigate Firewall.,"To use fortigate for East-West filtering (Inter-VPC Connection via Transit Gateway, Central Egress to Internet, Site to Site VPNs to AWS, Direct Connect traffic) and North-South with Gateway Load Balancer (for Internet Originating Traffic to the Applications)","To achieve, increased isolation and filter of network traffic within the AWS environment, allowing increased network security.
