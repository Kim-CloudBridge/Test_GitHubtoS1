3,Networking,Ingress,Accepted,Cloud Bridge,We have proposed a Centralised or Distributed Edge to implement for the architecture,Lendscape preferred Centralised Edge for now due to cost of maintaining full Distributed,"* Shared Resources:
* Consistent Policies",* Single Point of Failure,
4,Compute,EC2 Sizes per Tier,Open,Cloud Bridge,"We have created a reference architecture showing sizes of instances per Tier. This is based on Assess Analysis Document shared during initial phases, plus knowledge of Lendscape architecture",Lendscape noted of the similarity between Tier 3 and Tier 2 sizing and cost,,,
5,Active Directory,AWS Managed Microsoft AD for OS authentication,Superseded,Cloud Bridge,"Lendscape requires to have an Active Directory for server domain join and OS authentication in AWS. They have an existing AD that they use on premise, and an Azure AD.","* Lendscape wanted to have a new Active Directory to use in AWS. Currently, we plan to use this AD as standalone and no integration or connection to other AD. But in the future, there might have plans to establish forest trust in the On-premise AD.
* The AWS Managed AD will be provisioned in a central AWS account (Shared services account) and will be shared to the other AWS accounts in Lendscape's LZ","* Easy to setup as it is a managed service and less operational overhead.
* Ready for integration to on-premise AD
* Highly available setup","* More costly than the traditional Microsoft AD servers.
* Limited customization. Depending on the use case, the AWS Managed AD offers less flexibility than the traditional Microsoft AD servers.",
6,Pilot,EC2 for instances and database,Accepted,Cloud Bridge,"Due to limitations due to short delivery times, for the pilot phase, we will focus on testing that the workloads work on AWS on the designed basic infrastructure.","A ""lift & shift"" without block-replication will be done with test data on empty EC2 instances with Windows and Windows SQL Server.","* Easy to setup.
* Ready for integration to on-premise AD
* This will allow Cloud Bridge to shadow building and installation process ",* We will not be testing the linux re-platforming,

9,Pilot,RDS Custom to be applied after pilot phase,Rejected,Lendscape,"DSP has recommended this approach for DB in order to be able to support in RDS PostgreSQL, all the features customer requires from SQL Server. Updated: At the moment, Lendscape is not going to implement RDS Custom",Decision rejected at the moment as Lendscape is progressing on using current SQL Server clusters on EC2,"* In theory, RDS Custom will implement everything required","* We don’t have expertise on RDS Custom
* Features/Limitations unknown",
10,Pilot,HA for SQL Servers,Accepted,Lendscape,Lendscape currently doesn’t have HA at the DB layer,"Lendscape wants Cloud Bridge to set up an Always On HA SQL Cluster. Cloud Bridge can only offer help and some AWS official guides, so Lendscape will do the work with CB assitance",* HA for the pilot phase,"* CB not experts at SQL Server
* Work to be discarded if we move to RDS Custom",
11,Pilot,Pilot scope in terms of system outputs,Accepted,Lendscape,Definition of what is the customer type to be onboarded and what the application should contain,Justin has proposed to have dummy data on the pilot infrastructure and application and then perform a security analysis before on board an actual customer,"* Easy to setup.
* Ready for integration to on-premise AD
* Security posture improved from the beginning ",,
12,Pilot,Pilot Tier,Accepted,Cloud Bridge,There are three possible tiers to implement. Tier 1 and Tier 3 are very different in terms of infrastructure,Cloud Bridge will implement Tier 1 solution for the POC delivery,* Focusing on proving workload working on AWS,* We will need to deploy Tier 3 after the pilot phase as top priority to have a feeling of network cost,
13,Pilot,Typo Mistake,Accepted,Cloud Bridge,"During the creation of the accounts for the 0000poc customer, the testing account (1 of 3) was named wrongly as Client 0123",Ivor checked client list and opted for just keep working as it's as they don't have this customer with them anymore,Cloud Bridge has not to remove/rename it saving time,AFT Module has a tech debt for removing and renaming accounts as it is not a simple task - This will need to be explained in a runbook way in the future,
14,Active Directory,AWS Managed Microsoft AD for OS authentication,Accepted,Cloud Bridge/Lendscape,Lendscape requires to have an Active Directory for server domain join and OS authentication in AWS. The AWS-managed AD will be used across possibly 50+ client accounts of Lendscape it will also be used cross-region.,To use standard edition AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory in a central account that will be shared to other account without the use of directory sharing.,* The directory will be shared to other accounts via the transit gateway network with the right security group rules. Directory service sharing to other account has a per hour and per account cost so we won't have to perform this to other accounts. This will be a cheaper cost as we can offset the per hour and per account hourly cost.,"* Cross-region AD feature is not available in the Standard edition. Will have to find a workaround to be able to connect the servers in another region
* Need to create a custom automation script to join/unjoin instances to the domain.",

17,Pilot,Use of Amazon FSx for Windows for SQL FCI,Superseded,Lendscape,Lendscape will need a file share to use for SQL FCI File-share witness. Amazon FSx for windows is commonly used as file-share witness when forming SQL FCI.,To use Amazon FSx for Windows with Multi-AZ as file-share witness in SQL FCI,"* FSx for Windows is a managed service and Lendscape won't have to maintain a server. It's easy to use and mount ready for the EC2 Windows instances.
* Offer multi-AZ option which offers higher availability for the file share","* Costly compared to EC2 alternatives, which is normal for AWS Managed services.",
18,Pilot,Use of Amazon FSx for Netapp for SQL FCI,Accepted,Lendscape,"Lendscape will need a file share to use for SQL FCI File-share witness.

20,AWS Landing Zone,One AWS Account for each Domain,Accepted,Lendscape,"A Domain in Lendscape space can be equivalent to PROD, TEST, or DR. This is similarly known as Environment names. Lendscape has their environments under each Domain to cover the multiple environment approach their client has, and to completely set the demarcation line between live and non-live resources.",To use one AWS account per Domain present for the onboarded clients,"* To achieve, is a simpler and organized approach, and is not very far from the original Organization proposal by Cloud Bridge. It imposes complete control and governance for each Domain.

","* While accepting, it is to be noted that Domains are not to be confused with Environments. Furthermore, higher environment like pre-prod is considered a part of PROD domain due to likelyness to production as opposed to being part of TEST domain being it non-live.",
21,Networking,Keep Network Architecture for APAC,Accepted,Lendscape,"APAC region as of Feb-24 will only be moving 2 T3 clients into AWS space, engaging with the question of whether it is economical or practical to keep the architecture the same as in EMEA.","To keep APAC networking the same as EMEA, meaning no changes will be applied from networking perspective to impose scale-down regardless of clients moving into it.","* To achieve, a more similar regional presence will continue, simplifying admin and management from development and operational perspective.
